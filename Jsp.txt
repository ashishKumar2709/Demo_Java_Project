JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web content using Java. 
It allows developers to embed Java code into HTML pages, enabling the creation of server-side web applications. 
Jsp gives implicit objects ie when it run the .jsp file is converted to servlet
And all the objects required by the code ie request, out is created inside a service method of servlet class. 

JSP has four types of tags

1.JSP Directives: <%@page import =<package1>,<package2>...%> this for importing the packages
2.Scripting Elements:
	a) Declarations: To declare variables in the servlet class but before the service method eg: <%! int count = 0; %>
	b) Scriptlets: Which gets executed when the page is called. eg: <% count++; %>
	c) Expressions: For output expressions. eg: <%= count %> (same as out.println(count))
	
There are three main types of JDBC directives:
1.Page directive: Defines content type, importing java classes, session behavior etc
	<%@ page attribute="value" %>
	common attributes defined here are:
	-language: Specifies the scripting language. Default is "java".
	-contentType: Defines the MIME type of the page (e.g., "text/html; charset=UTF-8").
	-import: Allows you to import Java classes.
	-session: Specifies whether the page participates in an HTTP session (default is true).
	-errorPage: Defines a JSP page to redirect to when an error occurs.
	-isErrorPage: Specifies whether the current page is an error page (true or false).
	
2.Include directive: Includes content from another file.
	e.g. including header and footer file:
		<%@ include file="header.jsp" %>
		<html>
		<head>
		    <title>Include Directive Example</title>
		</head>
		<body>
		    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
		    <p>This content comes from the main JSP page.</p>
		    
		    <%@ include file="footer.jsp" %>
		</body>
		</html>
		
3.Taglib directive: Declares tag library which is a collection of custom tags used in jsp pages.
	e.g.: <%@ taglib uri="uri" prefix="prefix" %>

	
	//exception object is only available if isErrorPage tag is true for the page
